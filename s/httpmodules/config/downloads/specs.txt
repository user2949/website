Please subscribe it helped me out a ton. I just wanted to tell you guys my old channel could get more then 1K subscribers by now
And when i was reaching the goal. A massive wall appeared that cannot be broken. And my channel fall to its death. This is why i created a new youtube channel. Its all just to entertain you and somewhat get the amount of subscribers from my old channel. The goal to 1K has not been reached since then. I have tried. All has failed. Now this is the only way that i can ever get money to buy internet / school / food / expenses / many more just to help my parents. But all has failed. Now my only option is Youtube. I cannot quit. I am going to be on youtube filming youtube. Until my death. Even if im old im still going to be vlogging. Now im 13. I will do a face reveal if we reach the same amount of subscribers as the old one. Which has 237 subscribers right now and it is privated channel and all of the video is deleted from existence.
 
Nothing can stop me from making videos. You can join my discord server if you want to.
I will always make videos non-stop. Never ever going away. I will reach my goals and never give up. 
 
Moral : Dont give up. Your dreams will come true.
 
Thanks for all of the support. Now you may leave my pastebin. Im sorry if my videos are bad. You can comment if you would like to.
I will try my best to fix my problems and try to fix them. Im trying my best to reach my goals. Never give up. Do what you got to do. 
 
Thanks. This is a miracle.
