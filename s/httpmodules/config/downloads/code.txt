[[File:Photo-1438786657495-640937046d18.jpg|thumb|First known photo of Level Habitable]]
Level Habitable has different zones in it. It has 4 zones to be exact. And you should stay in the main area, the main area is the safest place to be in. There are no harmful entities and a 24-hour daylight cycle. At night they will be no entities at all. The size is about 282 million square kilometers in size. People can meet each other in the level because peoples always when entering the level spawns in the center. When entering the level you will see a very hilly terrain. It is impossible to die in Zone 1 (Aka. Habitable Zone) when entering other zones it is possible to die. Only the main area has this protection. If the entities try to go up there is a barrier that prevents entities from getting up to the surface preventing massive injuries to the wanderers. Almond water can even be founded. There is a lot of almond water at this level. If you are dehydrated when entering this level you can drink the water from this level. This level has an infinite amount of almond water and can be founded everywhere in the level. The level has entities such as Cows, Sheep, Friendly Bears, Friendly Dogs, and Helpful Creatures. These entities are very safe and could not be killed at this level. They produce an infinite amount of food and if you need food just feed them grass which there is an infinite amount of grass here, by feeding them grass they will give you food as a gift, any grass can be accepted. When entering this level you automatically get a feeling of calmness and nostalgia, even if you never visited this hilly grassy plain in real life, wanderers stated by drinking Almond Water which could be founded everywhere can remove the nostalgia effect permanently. There are a lot of trees here there are billions of trees converting carbon dioxide to oxygen. It can be founded everywhere and you can breathe the best oxygen. There is a lot of oxygen at this level, especially in the main area, the oxygen is very safe to breathe and is safe for people. If you drink Liquid Pain and went to this level the effect will automatically clear. This level has houses that you can live in, you can also make houses, by buying trees you can destroy the trees because you have claimed your land, you can claim lands, the maximum amount you can buy is 750x750km in size which costs about 2000 grass, there is the economy here, this level is first discovered on September 24th, 1990 by an Anonymous Person still living inside the level itself and still didn't die to this date, You could not hate or kill people in this level, when attempting to hate or kill people when hating people it makes your mouth doesn't move and you can't say anything, when done talking it would allow to open the mouth again and let the person talk, this will happen every time you try to hate someone when attempting to kill someone you will be teleported to the most dangerous part of the level which is zone 4 which is the deadliest zones in this level. When attempting to punch someone you will be teleported to where you enter the level which is in the center of the level, government and continents exist on this level and it separates and makes borders around, the government controls everything, and the rules themselves, when attempting to break one you will get punished and sent to jail by the police officers which guards the continent 24/7 there are 5 different continents, the first is HAB-1 ZONE the second is DEG ZONE the third is FIV ZONE every single continent must have "ZONE" with uppercases at all times. If there is no "ZONE" it makes the continent not possible to make and the person creating the continent will be jailed for 2 real-life months or about 4 days in the level.

== Zone 2 "Caves" ==
{{Class 2|class=Class 2|safety=Unsafe|security=Secure|entity=Low Entity Count}}
This level is the second zone of this level which is also known as the caves of this level. It's the dangerous part of the level. This zone contains Smilers, Hounds, and Dullers, this level is a caved zone that has a lot of dripstones and harmful entities inside of it, its not recommended to enter this level unless you need some money to get some land and make continents, the economy is $$$ which can be found as ores, they are very easy to mine just touch them using your hand it should automatically be plain money, These money ores can be found everywhere in the cave, the cave is approximately 181 million square kilometers wide and every 1 kilometer should have at least 500000$ and can be found everywhere in the cave, To exit this zone you must say "Zone 1" then you will be redirected back to Zone 1 or the habitable zone and you can find many different ores such as Emeralds which costs about 6000000 $$$ in this level, they are very rare in this level just 1 / 15 of this level! And if you find diamonds you are lucky! They cost about 50000000 $$$ in this level, they are 1 / 50 of this level, if you managed to find it you are very lucky! But they are guarded by Hounds and Dullers protecting the diamond from being destroyed or mined, every single ore must have a hardness level the hardest out of all of them are diamonds which take about 60 seconds to break using your hand and takes 35 seconds to break using a pickaxe from real life, to mine emerald it only takes about 45 seconds to break using your hand and 5 seconds to break using a pickaxe, Of course, they are guarded by Hounds, If unlucky enough they are a swarm of them. When entering a zone you of course spawn in the center of the zone, you can enter zone 3 by saying the same thing just say "Zone 3 ABCCC" and you will be teleported there the ABCCC is to verify you want to go there because that is the last and most dangerous level. It is possible to die at this level.

== Zone 3 "Maze of Hell" ==
{{Class 5|safety=Unsafe|security=Unsecure|entity=Entity Infestation}}
This is the deadliest part of this entire level. Welcome to Zone 3 this is how you end, It is possible to die in this level as well, If you hear a monster run it sure heard you, run to the nearest hole that sends you back to Zone 1 which is the safe part of this level, Or you can just say "Zone 1" to enter zone 1 automatically like in the previous level, This is a 100km maze which if you are unlucky you are spawned with a swarm of entities behind you, The entities always spawn at the center of the zone, It is 100km square kilometers in size and you when spawned you will be in a maze if you are unlucky the entities will spawn at the center of the zone and you will be 100 meters away from the entities when you are lucky you started in a maze that is not infested with entities, there are 5 different types of entities existing in this level, there is Smilers, Deathmoths, Hounds, Rattlers, and Skin-Stealers. To go back to zone 2 you must say "Zone 2" and you will be teleported to the level. This level has the [[Level 12]] effect and every single photo that has been taken has been very low imaged quality or doesn't even show at all, so there is no photograph because videos and images could not be taken on this level, photographer after recording or taking photos will be killed because taking photos in this level is not allowed, when taking photo or recording you will automatically see a horde of entities running towards you until you stop recording then it will teleport away about 1 kilometer away from you,

== Zone 4 "Flat Lands" ==
[[File:Flat.jpg|thumb|The first image of Zone 4.]]
{{Class 0|safety=Safe|security=Secure|entity=Devoid of Entities}}
Welcome to Zone 4 I hope you enjoy your stay. This zone is discovered by an Anonymous Person on August 24th 1994 this is the first image of Zone 4, The photographer was presumed dead on August 26th 1994, when entering this level you will see a very flat land which is stretching for 567 million square miles, this zone is an desert which is flat, quiet and has a low amount of oxygen in it because there is less trees and less plants on this zone, To enter this zone you just have to no-clip under a table on houses in Zone 1 and you will be sent here, to exit this zone you must no-clip through the grass and it will send you back to Zone 1, Do not attempt no-clipping into a very small house that has no people inside of it, if there is no people never no-clip into the windows because there is a 99.92% chance you are going to be sent to [[The Void]] falling for eternity at an unending distance, Zone 4 does not have animals or lakes here, the entire zone is completely desert and there is no grassy hilly plains here, there is only a flat land, and if you somehow get trapped here after 5 days you will be sent back to the exact time you entered Zone 4, at daytime its peaceful with no entities but...

== Zone 4 "Night Time" ==
[[File:Photo-attempt.png|thumb|Photo attempt in Zone 4. (Night Time)]]
{{Class 5|safety=Unsafe|security=Unsecure|entity=Entity Infestation}}
When night time strikes the zone will be infested with entities spawning millions every single second across the entire zone and when you take pictures in this level it would be pitch black, Its so dark that you can't even see your hand and its completely like The Void, whats even dangerous about this zone is there is no 12 hour daylight cycle its like someone just turned off the lamps, when night its pitch black but at daylight its very bright but there is no cycle in this zone only Zone 1 has the 24 hour daylight cycle so its automaticlly switching between nighttime and daytime, when it is nighttime the daytime is going to be completely gone and there will be no light at all, and its going to be completely pitch black, now entities will spawn every single milisecond has passed over 500000+ every single second at night time and clears out all of the entities at daytime, there is going to be millions of Smilers, Hounds, Hostile Facelings, Always Hungry-Skin Stealers, Wretches, Untamable Deathmoths, Rattlers, etc will spawn every single milisecond, So if it turns night time exit the zone as fast as possible by no-clipping anywhere will send you to Zone 1.

== Zone 5 "Deadzone Area" ==
{{Class Deadzone|safety=Very Unsafe|security=Exceedingly Unstable|entity=Entity Infestation}}
This is the most dangerous part of the entire level and has every single entity it's completely pitch black but when you enter the level you have 5 seconds to look around you before everything goes pitch black like someone just turned off the lamp after 5 seconds in. As you can see on the image it has black and white colors with the entity called "Something behind the scenes" when entering this level you will be greeted with a black and white looking bacteria but it's an unending space of pitch black, after 5 seconds have passed it will become pitch black and there will be billions of entities every single second that has passed, There exists Wretches, Very Hungry Skin-Stealers, Untammable Hostile Deathmoths, Hostile Kitty, Hounds, Rattlers, Smilers, Wall Worms and every other entity in the backrooms entity list
