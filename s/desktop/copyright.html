<title>Copyright Strikes</title>
<h1>Copyrighting</h1>
<p>When a video is copyrighted on my channel they usualy use the CC-BY-3.0 licence or the Creative Commons Attribution licence or i go to the description then say this video is Copyrighted and no footages could not be taken, If taken the video will be copyrighted and monetization will be blocked, Blocked for videos is usually such as Face Reveals, Vlogs. When a video is copyrighted in my channel it will deny embedding and sampling and also disables likes and comments.</p>
<p>Hey there! Wondering what do i use for recording? Well i use OBS Studio. Today i uploaded a new video called "face reveal", This video will automaticlly get copyrighted. This video can never be publiclly stolen or published.

<h2>How to not get copyrighted</h2>
<p>To not get Copyrighted you must first email the owner or contact the owner of something to get rights to use the uploaded video or the same thumbnails, Not doing it can cause your videos to not be monetized and you'll have to cut that part out of the video, I really dont like comments lying around my new video i uploaded without permissions. Make sure to get permissions!</p>
